This mod is intended to be a complete dynamic RPG addition to minecraft. It can be ignored in a minecraft world if necessary (literally just avoid going near any village-like settlements that aren't regular villages; don't talk to the people, don't be seen by them, don't even carry a sword when near them or they will TALK). 
It includes:
* Sim-like entities (they are agender/non-binary and I will not give them genders, so do not request genders, please) known as citizens appearing as players. They have personalities, hobbies, jobs, relationships, and genes which they can pass on.
* Empires, collections of village-like areas all centered around a single village-like structure which has inter-village interaction and a central government with leaders. It also will (usually?) have a deity that is central to it.
* A magic system involving practical ritualism.
* A more deity-oriented magic system involving the "inner realm of the mind" which expands regular mystical capabilities
* 4 major races; these races aren't completely quadrinary because genes can be mixed creating different hybrids. Humans, fairies, draconians, and trolls
* Higher beings, spirits, which can take the forms of citizens or possess them: specters and demons, which possess; fae/vaettir, which take the forms of citizens; and deities, which take the forms of citizens and are worshiped by them, their power changing with their worship.
* Transformed beings transformed with magic: vampires, werewolves, zombies, and ghosts. Zombies are just citizens with their AI overriden to be a zombie-like AI. Werewolves shapeshift uncontrollably on the full-moon phase (but can learn to control it, perhaps?). Vampires must drink blood from citizens or players regularly. Ghosts have an Insanity level at its highest and can phase through blocks and fly and are not considered living citizens.
* Perhaps a way to create your own transformed beings with magic? That would be REALLY cool. And maybe your own genes, too. Make an entire race of supernatural beings by cursing someone?

Ores:
* Salt: Found in the same configuration as coal

Items:
* Scraper: A device craftable using iron in the shape of a stick with salt on the end; this device can be right-clicked on a mob to store its species
* Lycopodium Powder: Dropped by lycopodium, if right-clicked on an entity will store its body's UUID. A form-changing magic can fool lycopodium.
* Block-bag: Crafted using leather, a silk-touch enchantment book, and a pickaxe; will be capable of storing any block which can be mined using the pickaxe used to craft it, storing the block and tile entity's exact state. Using the bag while sneaking will place the block and empty the bag; while not-shifting the bag will do nothing.

Plants:
* Lycopodium: Drops lycopodium powder when harvested.

Mobs:
* Living Block: We'll see if there's a use for these... they basically just look like blocks and have health proportional to their blocktype.
* Citizen: Citizens are the most complex being in all of the mod. They either work in villages (a special kind) or are part of empires. Every citizen has a mind with certain traits and memories which determine the chance of them performing certain actions. Citizens have: <ul>
  <li>GENES: Inheritable traits which can be Mendelian or random that determine their appearance and abilities
<li>PERSONALITY TRAITS (data which determines which actions they can perform and when they perform them)
<li>NEEDS (data which determines which action they intend to perform at a given moment by examining their stats)
<li>Hunger (simple enough, eat to replenish it. When citizens get hungry, they look for food. If they don't have food, they look for money and go buy. IF they don't have money, they work. Simple)
<li>EMOTION (social needs, mental needs, etc, which motivate citizens to perform tasks)
<li>KNOWLEDGE (information they remember which impact their mood and relationships and abilities; they can give this knowledge to each other and to players who ask them; they may also lie about their knowledge if their honesty level is low)
<li>OCCURRENCES (citizens can witness other entities performing certain actions; the citizen will remember the actions it witnesses and react to them appropriately. E.g. a citizen seeing a murder might run away or spread gossip about it or step in to help. Certain citizen actions also directly affect another citizen and thus cause the citizen to directly react)
<li>TRADES (some citizens can trade; specifically merchants)
<li>SKILLS (these are their capability at performing certain tasks and can influence citizen's actions; e.g. a butcher citizen with magic skills might ask animals for meat rather than killing them for it)
<li>JOBS (citizens do jobs like villagers but can change jobs if they don't like a job or if they're doing badly in a job)
<li>HOBBIES (tasks citizens do when they're not in their job that make them happy)
<li>RELATIONSHIPS (citizens can have [genderless] parents, children, and make friends based on similar hobbies; they can milk friendships into romantic relationships and have children if their personality value lets them)
<li>PLANS (citizens can queue tasks involving multiple steps and even multiple citizens for the future)
<li>PROJECTIONS (maybe citizens can build schematics by storing it in memory and performing queued tasks to complete it in a sufficiently empty space; this would be useful for citizens with magic skill to build rituals. It could also allow citizens to remember the configurations of their "houses" so they can fix it, which could be cool)
</ul>
* Spirits:<ul>
  <li>?
  </ul>

Concepts:
* Skill: Both citizens and players have a "sliding" skill level. Some skills are only available to citizens, though, since players have no use for them, and citizens need them for certain jobs. Skills cannot be developed unless they're "activated," which must be performed by a MASTER. They can be LAYPERSON (does not have skill), NOVICE (first level; first level abilities), APPRENTICE (second level; capable of doing this skill but not of making money from it), WORKER (third level; capable of doing a job using this skill and making money), MASTER (fourth level; capable of activating another entity's ability to start leveling up in this skill), and GRANDMASTER (fifth level; usually has special power over this skill, e.g. a Grandmaster Explorer can give out tasks to lower explorers). Skill levels deteriorate very, very slowly, by neglect; three days of neglect might decrease one level. Skills can be maintained by certain tasks related to the skill. Skills exclusive to players will be labeled "Player-Only Skill"; skills exclusive to citizens will be labeled "Citizen-Only Skill".<ul>
  <li>Combat: This skill introduces more attack damage, quicker attack speed, (longer attack reach?), and the ability to attack by spinning (maybe more skills, idk, combat balancing isn't really my strong suit). This skill is maintained through attacking, which can be done on Dummies if there are no monsters around
    <li>Farming: This skill introduces higher reaps when farming and actually causes hoes to have a chance of not losing durability when farming, which increases with skill levels. A grandmaster can use a hoe without it losing durability and always is capable of replanting crops after harvesting them. Bone-meal chance also increases with this skill's increase. Additionally, with this skill above novice-level players have a chance of obtaining Fertilizer from destroying grass blocks, which acts as automatic bonemeal with no random chance to it and which has a small radius of effect. If fertilizer is used on a bare dirt/grass block, it will turn into fertilized dirt for one day, which causes plants planted on it to grow faster without need for water and have a greater harvest
      <li>Magic: This skill introduces the ability to make rituals, multi-block-structures which have magical effects when their focal block is right-clicked or receives redstone. Rituals cannot be created by citizens without this skill nor can they be manipulated (an existing ritual can have a redstone signal fed into it but will not be manipulable by a layperson of the magic skill). A novice has a 1/4th chance of successfully building a ritual, an apprentice has a 1/2 chance, and a worker has a 3/4 chance. Master has a 99% chance and Grandmasters are guaranteed. Additionally, the higher the skill level the more ritualistic magical effects the citizen unlocks.
 </ul>
* Empires: These are centered in "palaces" (woodland mansion-type buildings with a throne in their center) and have a leader. They also have a network of information via mailbox blocks. An empire conquers villages by forcing them to convert to their religion. When enough citizens of a village convert, the empire has taken over the village (based on the positions of the villagers' beds and meeting point). At that point, a mailbox will be built for the empire.
* Ritualism: This requires a sufficient Magic skill. It works by having components to create magical effects.<ul>
  <li>Centerblock: The centerblock is activated to start the ritual by redstone or barehandedly. The centerblock will require a certain number of lapis lazuli to start the ritual, which can be fed into it using a hopper. 
  <li>Zone: This is a ring of salt around the ritual; salt can only be placed by people with the magic skill. This is where the ritual will apply its effects, within this zone. The centerblock can be anywhere within this zone.
  <li>Obelisk: these are four pillars of granite at the corners of the centerblock that determine how high the ritual affects; the ritual will naturally affect two blocks high (the two lowest blocks do not need to be granite) and as far up as all four pillars go; differing heights prevents the ritual from working.
    <li>Temporal Pillars: This is a pillar of blocks on top of the centerblock; it does not need to touch the centerblock but must occupy the same column, be unbroken, and within the zone. Each coal block increases the ritual duration by four seconds; each iron block by twenty seconds; each redstone block by a minute and a half; each emerald block by two minutes; gold by four minutes; diamond by eight minutes. Blocks must be placed with the lowest time blocks on bottom and others above, and each temporal pillar must have the same configuration.
    <li>Sigils: Sigils are made within the Zone of the ritual to cause its effects. Sigils can be placed by a person with magic skill by right clicking the tops of blocks inside a zone with certain items. 
      <li>Target Sigil: A target sigil is a sigil that determines where the ritual's effects target within its zone. It must be placed adjacent to the column of the world the centerblock is in (it can be at any y value within the zone but must be adjacent to the centerblock) <ul>
        <li>All sigil: Selects all living entities within the zone, made using a bone
        <li>Name Sigil: A name sigil, made by using a nametag, will scan for all entities in the zone which are of the given name and apply its effects to them. This includes players and named mobs.
          <li>Type Sigil: A type sigil, made using a scraper, will scan for all entities of the specified type
            <li>Block-type Sigil: A block-type sigil, made by right-clicking using a block-bag, will scan for all blocks of the state stored in it (it will ignore the tile entity state, however).
            <li>Identity Sigil: An identity sigil, made using lycopodium, scans for all entities wearing the form of the entity stored in it (usually this is one entity, but it could potentially be more)
            <li>Trait Sigil: A trait sigil scans for all entities with the data tags and entity selector(either can be left blank) that are inputted into its GUI. It will display the datatags of the opener, or, if the opener used a lycopodium powder on it, the mob supplied to it using the powder, as reference, so the player will find it easier to write the right tags (the selector, however, will have no references. It also will be unable to select mobs outside the zone regardless of parameters).
        </ul>
        <li>Effect Sigil: 
  </ul>
* Alchemy: This requires a sufficient alchemy skill<ul>
  <li>
  </ul>
* 
* Inner Realm: A personal dimension for each player where they have limitless building capability (a creative menu with all vanilla items and all craftable modded items, though items can be excluded in config or by using a helper method which I will add to API). Since items cannot be transferred from the inner realm <strong>to</strong> the physical realm without high level magic, this shouldn't be a huge deal. The inner realm can be used by a player to not only build creatively <strong>from survival</strong>, but also view their own relationships and status effects in a physical form (perhaps among other things, this mod is still in the brainstorming and some-development stage). One important part of the inner realm is that it allows for ritual creation within it to allow for dynamic ritual creation, or rather, spellcasting. E.g. right click an item and apply the effects of a ritual instead of taking the time to build it in the middle of a battle. Perhaps citizens will be able to use something similar, though there is <strong>no way in hell</strong> I am giving every citizen their own personal dimension because that would use up too much memory and lag everything.

Blocks:
* Throne: The center of an empire; the throne is the place the ruler goes and determines the empire's center. Only one throne can exist in an empire center chunk; more thrones will simply break and if no thrones are in an empire center chunk the empire will either rebuild or will change its center chunk.
