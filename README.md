This mod is intended to be a complete dynamic RPG addition to minecraft. It can be ignored in a minecraft world if necessary (literally just avoid going near any village-like settlements that aren't regular villages) but is probably very useful and fun (i may be biased)
It includes:
* Sim-like entities (they are agender/non-binary and I will not give them genders) known as citizens appearing as players. They have personalities, hobbies, jobs, relationships, and genes which they can pass on.
* Empires, collections of village-like areas all centered around a single village-like structure which has inter-village interaction and a central government with leaders. It also will (usually?) have a deity that is central to it.
* A magic system involving practical ritualism.
* A more deity-oriented magic system involving the "inner realm of the mind" which expands regular mystical capabilities
* 4 major races; these races aren't completely quadrinary because genes can be mixed creating different hybrids. Humans, fairies, draconians, and trolls
* Higher beings, vaettir, which can take the forms of citizens or possess them: spirits and demons, which possess; landvaettir, which take the forms of citizens; and deities, which take the forms of citizens and are worshiped by them, their power changing with their worship.
* Transformed beings transformed with magic: vampires, werewolves, zombies, and ghosts. Zombies are just citizens with their AI overriden to be a zombie-like AI. Werewolves shapeshift uncontrollably on the full-moon phase (but can learn to control it, perhaps?). Vampires must drink blood from citizens or players regularly. Ghosts have an Insanity level at its highest and can phase through blocks and fly and are not considered living citizens.
* Perhaps a way to create your own transformed beings with magic? That would be REALLY cool. And maybe your own genes, too.

Ores:

Mobs:
* Living Block: We'll see if there's a use for these... they basically just look like blocks and have health proportional to their blocktype.
* Citizen: Citizens are the most complex being in all of the mod. They either work in villages (a special kind) or are part of empires. Every citizen has a mind with certain traits and memories which determine the chance of them performing certain actions. Citizens have: 
<ul>
<li>PERSONALITY TRAITS (data which determines which actions they can perform and when they perform them)
<li>NEEDS (data which determines which action they intend to perform at a given moment by examining their stats)
<li>Hunger (simple enough, eat to replenish it. When citizens get hungry, they look for food. If they don't have food, they look for money and go buy. IF they don't have money, they work. Simple)
<li>EMOTION (social needs, mental needs, etc, which motivate citizens to perform tasks)
<li>GOSSIP (information they remember which they give to each other and to players who ask them; these info bits may be lies; if the information is about a certain entity this affects their behavior toward the entity)
<li>SIGHTS (citizens can see other entities; if the entity is doing a certain action while the citizen looks at it the citizen will remember the action and react appropriately. E.g. a citizen seeing a murder might run away or spread gossip about it or step in to help)
<li>TRADES (some citizens can trade; specifically merchants)
<li>SKILLS (these are their capability at performing certain tasks and can influence citizen's actions; e.g. a butcher citizen with magic skills might ask animals for meat rather than killing them for it)
<li>JOBS (citizens do jobs like villagers but can change jobs if they don't like a job or if they're doing badly in a job)
<li>HOBBIES (tasks citizens do when they're not in their job that make them happy)
<li>RELATIONSHIPS (citizens can have [genderless] parents, children, and make friends based on similar hobbies; they can milk friendships into romantic relationships and have children if their personality value lets them)
<li>PLANS (citizens can queue tasks involving multiple steps and even multiple citizens)
</ul>

Concepts:
* Empires: These are centered in "palaces" (woodland mansion-type buildings with a throne in their center) and have a leader. They also have a network of information via mailbox blocks. An empire conquers villages by forcing them to convert to their religion. When enough citizens of a village convert, the empire has taken over the village (based on the positions of the villagers' beds and meeting point). At that point, a mailbox will be built for the empire.
* Ritualism: This requires an altar and certain configurations to perform an effect

Blocks:
* Throne: The center of an empire; the throne is the place the ruler goes and determines the empire's center. Only one throne can exist in an empire center chunk; more thrones will simply break and if no thrones are in an empire center chunk the empire will either rebuild or will change its center chunk.
